# Repository Description

This repository presents my technical tasks that I worked on
during my time at the Software Engineering bootcamp with CoGrammer.

The technical tasks have stretched my coding ability as well as my problem solving skills, it includes 
my thought process which are expressed as comments. 

I would be delighted if you review my tasks.

Thank you.
